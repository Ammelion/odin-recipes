    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Classic banana pudding is a delightful and comforting dessert that layers creamy homemade vanilla pudding with slices of ripe bananas and crunchy vanilla wafers. To create the pudding, you start by cooking a mixture of sugar, flour, salt, and milk over medium heat until it thickens. Tempered egg yolks are then added to the mixture to create a rich and smooth custard. The pudding is flavored with vanilla extract and allowed to cool slightly before assembly.</p>
    <p>In a baking dish, you alternate layers of vanilla wafers and banana slices, pouring the warm pudding over each layer to ensure every bite is filled with flavor and texture. Once all the layers are complete, a generous topping of freshly whipped cream, sweetened with powdered sugar and vanilla, is spread over the top. The assembled dessert is then chilled for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld and the pudding to set, resulting in a luscious and satisfying treat that is perfect for any occasion.</p>

        <li>Prepare the Pudding:

            In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, flour, and salt.
            Gradually whisk in the milk until smooth.
            Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to thicken and bubble.
            In a separate bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks.
            Gradually whisk a small amount of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks to temper them.
            Return the egg mixture to the saucepan and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the pudding is thickened (about 2-3 minutes).
            Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
            Let the pudding cool slightly.</li>
