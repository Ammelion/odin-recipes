    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Classic banana pudding is a delightful and comforting dessert that layers creamy homemade vanilla pudding with slices of ripe bananas and crunchy vanilla wafers. To create the pudding, you start by cooking a mixture of sugar, flour, salt, and milk over medium heat until it thickens. Tempered egg yolks are then added to the mixture to create a rich and smooth custard. The pudding is flavored with vanilla extract and allowed to cool slightly before assembly.</p>
    <p>In a baking dish, you alternate layers of vanilla wafers and banana slices, pouring the warm pudding over each layer to ensure every bite is filled with flavor and texture. Once all the layers are complete, a generous topping of freshly whipped cream, sweetened with powdered sugar and vanilla, is spread over the top. The assembled dessert is then chilled for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld and the pudding to set, resulting in a luscious and satisfying treat that is perfect for any occasion.</p>

            Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent.
            Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant.

            Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper (and optional red pepper flakes and red wine if using).
            Reduce the heat and let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:
        
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
            Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente according to package instructions.
            Drain the noodles and lay them flat on a sheet of parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:
        
            In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, beaten egg, grated Parmesan, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper.
            Mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna:
        
            Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
            Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
            Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish.
            Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.
            Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
            Add another layer of meat sauce and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella.
            Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce topped with mozzarella.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake the Lasagna:
        
            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Rest and Serve:
        
            Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
            Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.
            Serve and enjoy!</li>
